# Hurricaine_project
 Analysis of Hurricane damage in the US

 This project contained a series of open-ended requirements. There were many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I was expected to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when I encounted a problem that I could not easily solve.

Project Goals

To write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.
